# Simple Phar Builder

This project consists of a single class and is a very simple phar builder that can be used to build simple CLI apps into a single phar file.

## Why ?

Why a phar builder when the `box` project does the same thing with much more sophistication. Well that last word `sophistcation` is the answer.

In the end it was simpler to build my own tool than wade through the code of `box` trying to work out how to use.

## Install

Install from `github` using composer.
